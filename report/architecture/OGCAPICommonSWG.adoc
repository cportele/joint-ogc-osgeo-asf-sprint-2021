==== OGC API - Common

The draft OGC API - Common standard documents the set of common practices and shared requirements that have emerged from the development of Resource Oriented Architectures and Web APIs within the OGC. The specification serves as a common foundation upon which all OGC APIs will be built. Consistent with the architecture of the Web, this specification uses a resource architecture that conforms to principles of Representational State Transfer (REST). The specification establishes a common pattern that is based on OpenAPI.
