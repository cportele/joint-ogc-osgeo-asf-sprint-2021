==== OGC API - Features

The OGC API - Features standard offers the capability to create, modify, and query spatial data on the Web and specifies requirements and recommendations for APIs that want to follow a standard way of sharing feature data. The specification is a multi-part document. Part 1, labelled the Core, describes the mandatory capabilities that every implementing service has to support and is restricted to read-access to spatial data. Part 2 enables the use of different Coordinate Reference Systems, in addition to the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84). Additional capabilities that address specific needs will be specified in additional parts. Envisaged future capabilities include, for example, support for creating and modifying data, more complex data models, and richer queries.
