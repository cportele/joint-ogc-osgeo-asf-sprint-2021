==== interactive instruments ldproxy

ldproxy is an implementation of the OGC API family of specifications, based on the W3C/OGC Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices. It is written in Java (https://github.com/interactive-instruments/ldproxy[Source Code]) and is typically deployed using docker (https://hub.docker.com/r/iide/ldproxy/[DockerHub]). The software originally started in 2015 as a Web API for feature data based on WFS 2.0 capabilities. In addition to the JSON/XML encodings, an emphasis is placed on an intuitive HTML representation.

The current version supports WFS 2.0 instances as well as PostgreSQL/PostGIS databases as backends. It implements all conformance classes and recommendations of "OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core" and "OGC API - Features- Part 2: Coordinate Reference Systems By Reference", as well as other draft extensions (Part 3 and Part 4). ldproxy also has draft implementations for additional resource types (Tiles, Styles).
