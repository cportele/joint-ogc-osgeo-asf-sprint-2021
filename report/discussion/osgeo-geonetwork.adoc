==== OSGeo GeoNetwork

GeoNetwork team worked on a refactor of the code, related to OGC API Records. 
In previous iterations the YAML files provided by OGC were used to build a java skeleton. 
With the refactor the openapi document is generated from java code using the springfox library.
This allows us to add some properties and methods which are not in the standard (yet).

For example GeoNetwork provides DCAT, schema.org, Atom outputs of Metadata records in various encodings, 
such as html, json, (iso19139) xml, json-ld, rdf/xml and turtle.
