==== OSGeo GeoNetwork

GeoNetwork team worked on a refactor of the code, related to OGC API Records. 
In previous iterations the YAML files provided by OGC were used to build a java skeleton. 
With the refactor the openapi document is generated from java code using the springfox library.
This allows us to add some properties and methods which are not in the standard (yet).

For example GeoNetwork provides DCAT, schema.org, Atom outputs of Metadata records in various encodings, 
such as html, json, (iso19139) xml, json-ld, rdf/xml and turtle. 

Discussions from the sprint are documented:

- Add the thumbnail/graphicoverview fiels to the core record model https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-records/issues/94

- Start an initiative to create an extension for Facet Statistics https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-records/issues/52

- Multilingual aspects of metadata https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-records/issues/91

- Since GeoNetwork does support Atom/Opensearch, we should verify if we meet all requirements of conformance class, and if so, list it on the conformance endpoint

- It was previously not clear that GeoJSON will be a default (json) response format for record queries, it feels a bit awkward. 

- I tested the json-ld output of our OGC API Records endpoint with the Jena ARQ sparql client. It works for a single document, but queries don't continue into related 
records. Mostly because the json-ld context currently doesn't list relations to the collection or siblings. In theory I should be 
able to find the dcat:catalogue from a dcat:catalogueRecord, and from the catalogue, other records.
