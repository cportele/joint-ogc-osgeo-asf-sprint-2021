==== OSGeo GeoNetwork

The GeoNetwork team worked on a refactor of the code, related to OGC API - Records. In previous iterations the YAML files provided by OGC were used to build a Java skeleton.
With the refactor, the openapi document is generated from Java code using the https://springfox.github.io/springfox/[SpringFox] library. This allows the developer to add some properties and methods which are not (yet) in the standard.

For example GeoNetwork provides DCAT, schema.org, Atom outputs of Metadata records in various encodings, such as HTML, JSON, (ISO19139) XML, JSON-LD, RDF/XML and Turtle.

A list of discussions from the sprint is presented below:

- Add the thumbnail/graphicoverview fields to the core record model https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-records/issues/94

- Start an initiative to create an extension for Facet Statistics https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-records/issues/52

- Multilingual aspects of metadata https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-records/issues/91

- Since GeoNetwork does support Atom/Opensearch, verification is needed to confirm whether all requirements of conformance classes are met, and if so, this should be listed on the conformance endpoint

- It was previously not clear that GeoJSON will be a default (json) response format for record queries. This needs to be made clearer.

- The participants tested the json-ld output of one of the OGC API - Records implementations with the Jena ARQ SPARQL client. It worked for a single document, but queries did not continue into related records. Mostly because the json-ld context, at the time, did not list relations to the collection or siblings. In theory it should be possible to find the `dcat:catalogue` from a `dcat:catalogueRecord`, and from the catalogue, other records.
