==== OSGeo GeoServer

openlayers does not have support for OGC API - Maps. So the GeoServer team observed that

OGC APIs expect parameters to be case sensitive. In some cases however, for example with OpenLayers, the parameters can be of different case.

The team observed that there is a need to provide a way of displaying layerGroups. At the moment they are displayed as collections.
