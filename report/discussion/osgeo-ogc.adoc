==== OSGeo and OGC

As part of ongoing discussions regarding renewing the OSGeo/OGC Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU), there was discussion between Scott Simmons (OGC Chief Standards Officer) and members
of the OSGeo Board of Directors on assessing the current MOU as well as current
state of affairs.  In addition, there was discussion on opportunities to
strengthen the MOU given the OGC's increasing focus on developers and the
importance of free and open source software.

The draft MOU continues to be updated and will be tabled for review by both
organizations.
