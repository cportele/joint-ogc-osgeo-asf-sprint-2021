==== pgRouting

There was discussion about the potential to implement an OGC API - Routes interface on top of pgRouting. The participants acknowledged that the scope of pgRouting does not currently  APIs. However, the participants also acknowledged the potential benefit of ensuring that information provided by an OGC API - Routes implementation could be fully ingested by pgRouting and vice versa.
