==== pygeoapi and OWSLib

There was discussion about enabling pygeoapi to support x-array databases. An xarray database supports the labelling of data to indicate dimensions, coordinates and other attributes.

On the OWSLib side, there was discussion about doing an OGC API client. One of the options considered for adding to OWSLib was pydantic, a python-based framework for data validation. There was also discussion about doing OWS documentation in jupyter using Sphinx.
