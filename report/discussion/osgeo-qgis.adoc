Relevant to this development is the discussion at https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-records/issues/95.
QGIS facilitates to add the service layer to the map, when it detects the type of the service.
Current CSW implementation has a long algorythm of testing various metadata properties, the service url and probing the endpoint.

The Apache group was interested to use QGIS as a tool for data modification and then loading it into Fuseki.
They were looking for tooling that would export the data as RDF from QGIS. They found a solution using GeoServer as middleware, which 
has a community plugin at https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/community/json-ld/output.html, which offers json-ld capabilities.

QGIS has OGC API Features support.
